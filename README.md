# A bad game of life implementation

Someone I know implemented it in Java, so ofc I have to show him who's boss.

## How it works

The compilation features can be changed to either OpenGL rendering using glium or to
a terminal backend, which should support most terminals.

The computation is entirely done on the CPU (maybe use rust-gpu in the future to make
it faster?).
